How to submit a patch?
----------------------

In case you want to contribute, here is how to retrieve the current source
snapshot:

    $ TGZ="http://vladz.devzero.fr/svn/projects/fsnoop/releases/fsnoop-current.tar.gz"
    $ wget -q -O - ${TGZ} | tar -xzvf -
    $ cp -a trunk trunk.old

Modify the sources in the "trunk" directory.  Use "indent -brf -kr -i 2" to
indent your code and generate the patch with:

    $ TZ=UTC diff -aburN trunk.old trunk > patch-name_revision.patch

Send the file to vladz@devzero.fr.


Todo list:
----------

- In the "-fd" option, when we stop the monitor mode, we should only
  display the files opened by Fsnoop, and not all the fd descriptors opened
  by the process (stdin, stdout, pipes, etc.).

- In the "-fd" option, instead of a shell, a menu can be bound with the
  possibility to display/copy/rewind/close file descriptors.

- Add support for FreeBSD platform with kqueue and Solaris (see [3]).
